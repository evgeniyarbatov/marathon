He is the only person in history to run the marathon under two hours and one minute in a record-eligible race. Kiptum won three marathons he participated in, all renowned, including two top-tier World Marathon Majors (WMM), and held between December 2022 and October 2023. The times he achieved are three of the six fastest times in history, a course record under 2:02-hour in each case, making him the only man ever to break this barrier thrice. He ran the fastest ever marathon debut at the 2022 Valencia Marathon, becoming only the third man in history to break two hours and two minutes and setting the then fourth-quickest time ever. Kiptum followed it up four months later with the second fastest marathon in history at 2:01:25, 16 seconds outside the world record, at the 2023 London Marathon (WMM). In his next race, the Chicago Marathon (WMM) six months later in October 2023, the 23-year-old broke the world record by 34 seconds with a time of two hours 35 seconds.\n",

      "\u001b[1mEliud Kipchoge\u001b[0m (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliud_Kipchoge) Eliud Kipchoge  (born 5 November 1984) is a Kenyan long-distance runner who competes in the marathon and formerly specialized at the 5000 metre distance. Regarded as one of the greatest marathon runners of all time, he is the 2016 and 2020 Olympic marathon champion, and was the world record holder in the marathon with a time of 2:01:09 set at the 2022 Berlin Marathon, until that record was broken by Kelvin Kiptum at the Chicago Marathon on 8 October 2023 with a time of 2:00:35. He has run five of the 10 fastest marathons in history.Kipchoge claimed his first individual world championship title in 2003 by winning the junior race at the World Cross Country Championships and setting a world junior record over 5000 m on the track. At the age of eighteen, he became the senior 5000 m world champion at the 2003 World Championships with a championships record, then followed with an Olympic bronze for Kenya in 2004 and a bronze at the 2006 World Indoor Championships. A five-time World Championship 5000 m finalist, Kipchoge took silver medals at the 2007 World Championships, 2008 Beijing Olympics and 2010 Commonwealth Games. He switched to road running in 2012 and made the second-fastest half marathon debut ever, at 59:25. In his marathon debut, he won the 2013 Hamburg Marathon in a course record time. His first victory at a World Marathon Major came at the Chicago Marathon in 2014, and he went on to become series champion a record five times – for 2016, 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2022. He has won the London Marathon a record four times and also holds the record for most Berlin Marathon wins with five, his latest coming in September 2023. With 15 victories out of his 18 marathons, Kipchoge's only losses have been a second-place finish behind Wilson Kipsang Kiprotich at the 2013 Berlin Marathon, where Kipsang broke the world record, an eighth-place finish at the 2020 London Marathon and a sixth place in his debut at the Boston Marathon in 2023. Kipchoge's last world record run broke by 30 seconds his own 2018 world record, which was in turn a 78-second improvement over the existing best, the greatest improvement in a marathon world record time since 1967. On 12 October 2019, Kipchoge ran the marathon distance for the Ineos 1:59 Challenge in Vienna, achieving a time of 1:59:40.2, becoming the first person in recorded history to do a sub-two-hour marathon. The run did not count as a new marathon record, as standard competition rules for pacing and fluids were not followed, and it was not an open event.Kipchoge was appointed Elder of the Order of the Golden Heart by President Uhuru Kenyatta on 20 October 2019 in recognition of his sub-two-hour marathon. He was also named the 2019 BBC World Sport Star of the Year. In 2023 he was awarded the Princess of Asturias Award in the category \"Sports\".\n",

He was the world record holder in both the 5000-metre and 10000-metre from 2004 until 2020. He won the gold medal in both the 5000 m and 10,000 m events at the 2008 Summer Olympics. At the 2004 Olympics, he won the gold medal in the 10,000 m and the silver medal in the 5000 m. He is the most successful runner in the history of the IAAF World Cross Country Championships, with six long (12 km) course and five short (4 km) course titles. He won the 10,000 m title at the World Championships in Athletics in 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009 (matching Haile Gebrselassie's four in a row win streak). Kenenisa was unbeaten over 10,000 m from his debut in 2003 until 2011, when he failed to finish at the World Championships final. At the 2009 World Championships in Athletics he became the first man to win both 5000 m and 10,000 m title at the same championships. Over 5000 m he has also won an Olympic silver (2004), World Championship bronze (2003), two African Championship titles and one All-Africa Games gold medal. He also won the 3000 metres title at the 2006 World Indoor Championships. On 6 April 2014, he produced the sixth fastest marathon debut ever on a record-eligible course with his victory at the Paris Marathon, in a course record time of 2:05:04. On 25 September 2016, Kenenisa won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:03:03, a new personal best, then the third-fastest marathon of all time. On 29 September 2019, he again won the Berlin Marathon in a time of 2:01:41, two seconds slower than the then world record of 2:01:39 set by Eliud Kipchoge in the 2018 Berlin Marathon. Considering his accomplishments in cross country, track, and road racing, many consider him to be the greatest distance runner of all time.\n",

He ran in the junior category at the 2010 IAAF World Cross Country Championships and placed 16th overall – he was not a point-scoring runner for the Ethiopian team.  He returned to the same venue (Bydgoszcz) as a senior competitor at the 2013 IAAF World Cross Country Championships, though his 24th-place finish again left him out of the team point scoring. In 2012 he won the 10k Paderborner Osterlauf in Germany in 27:53 min. He became the first person to win twice at the Yangzhou Jianzhen International Half Marathon, winning four times in a row, including a course record of 59:52 minutes – the fastest achieved in a Chinese race. In 2015 he was the winner of the Ras Al Khaimah Half Marathon. On 15 May 2016 he won the Bangalore 10k in a time of 28:36, after his victory the previous year. At the 2018 edition of the run, he placed third in a time of 28:39 after fellow countrymen BIrhanu Legese with 28:38 and the winner Geoffrey Kamworor (Kenya) in 28:18.He achieved bigger popularity in 2018 by winning the Dubai Marathon in a course record time of 2:04:00 (with seven runners below 2:05) as well as a second place in the Chicago Marathon.At the 2019 London Marathon, he finished in second place behind Eliud Kipchoge with a time of 2:02:55, the third-fastest time in history.On 17 July 2022, Mosinet won his second World Championship Silver Medal in the 2022 World Athletics Championships – Men's marathon, finishing behind Tamirat Tola in a time of 2:06:44.\n",

He won two Olympic gold medals and four World Championship titles over the 10,000 metres. Haile triumphed in the Berlin Marathon four times consecutively and also had three straight wins at the Dubai Marathon. Further to this, he earned four world titles indoors and was the 2001 World Half Marathon Champion. Haile had major competition wins at distances between 1500 metres and the marathon, moving from outdoor, indoor and cross country running to road running in the latter part of his career. He broke 61 Ethiopian national records ranging from 800 metres to the marathon, set 27 world records, and is regarded as one of the greatest distance runners in history. He won the 2008 Berlin Marathon with a world record time of 2:03:59, breaking his own world record by 27 seconds. The record stood for three years. Haile's 10,000 m Masters age group world record has not been challenged since 2008. Haile was cited as one of the top 100 most influential Africans by New African in 2011. During the Hachalu Hundessa riots in 2020, Oromo mobs targeted the businesses and properties of non-Oromos. Haile's hotels and resort were burned and 400 employees lost their jobs. In 2021, in the midst of the Tigray War, he pledged to join the fighting against the Tigray People's Liberation Front.\n",

      "\u001b[1mRonald Korir\u001b[0m (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25K_run) The 25K run (25 kilometers, approximately 15.52 miles) is a long distance running footrace that is between the distance of a half marathon and a marathon. It was formerly an official world record distance in road running by World Athletics, but has since been downgraded to world best status. Separately, the Association of Road Racing Statisticians retains world records in the 25K distance. The ARRS holds different standards for records than World Athletics, with exclusions for certain point-to-point races and mixed sex races. As a result its women's world record is 1:26:34 by Nancy Conz, set in 1982.The distance was more common in the mid-20th century as mass road running was beginning to develop, but began declining with the increased popularity and familiarity of the marathon and half marathon distance. Some former 25K races have transitioned to shorter distances, with which runners and sponsors are more familiar. In particular, the establishment of the World Athletics Half Marathon Championships in 1992 proved a driver for private races and national championships to switch to the half marathon as the most common distance between the 10K run and the marathon. However, as trail running and ultra running continue to find larger participant fields, the 25K has become a more common trail race distance (many trail races and ultra races use the metric system). As runners prepare for a 100K run, they may do training race steps with a 25K followed by a 50K.\n",

The event was specifically created for Kipchoge and held in Vienna, Austria. Kipchoge had previously attempted to run a two hour marathon at the Breaking2 event organised by Nike in 2017, but he fell short by 25 seconds. He then went on to run a world record marathon at the 2018 Berlin Marathon before British chemicals company Ineos announced the attempt in May 2019. 41 pacemakers, rotating in and out in groups of 7, assisted Kipchoge throughout the attempt. Due to the presence of the pacemakers, delivery of hydration by bicycle, and the lack of open competition, the achievement was not eligible to be ratified as a marathon world record, and is not recognized as such by World Athletics.\n",

His best of 2:04:48 hours ranks him in the all-time top twenty for the event, as of 2016.He started his career as a steeplechaser and represented Ethiopia in that event at the 2009 World Youth Championships in Athletics, finishing in fifth place. He soon transitioned to road running and set a best of 1:01:25 hours to finish third at the 2010 Rabat Half Marathon. His marathon debut came the year after, with a sixth-place finish at the Marrakesh Marathon, then fourth at the Ljubljana Marathon with a time of 2:09:19 hours. He fell to fifth place at the 2012 Milan Marathon, but then took his first career victories over the distance in Ljubljana and Taiyuan.Berhanu had his breakout performance at the 2013 Dubai Marathon. In a quick race, he was runner-up to Lelisa Desisa with a time of 2:04:48 hours. The performance surprised athletes and coaches alike, given his improvement of over four minutes. This placed him in the all-time top twenty athletes for the distance. Reflecting the development of the event, this only placed sixth on the season's lists for 2013. He was slated for the 2013 Rotterdam Marathon but had to withdraw due to injury. He was absent from competition for more than two years. Upon his return to competition in 2015, he was far from his previous form. He was ninth at the Seoul International Marathon with 2:11:01 hours and failed to finish the Gold Coast Marathon. His time at the Beijing Marathon was relatively slow at 2:11:37 hours, but was enough for second place behind Mariko Kiplagat Kipchumba.\n",

He became the youngest man to run under 2:06 when he ran 2:05:23 in the men's marathon at the 2010 Rotterdam Marathon. He set his personal best of 2:04:52 in the marathon when he came in second place at the 2012 Chicago Marathon. He won the Dublin Marathon in 2009 in his debut race and then won the Xiamen International Marathon in 2010. He was the bronze medalist at the 2011 World Championships marathon and the silver medalist in the 2016 Rio Olympics marathon. On the final day of the 2016 Rio Olympics (21 August), as he was crossing the finish line of the Men's Marathon and winning his silver medal, he raised his arms in a gesture of solidarity with protestors against the killing of the Oromo people in his home country of Ethiopia. Citing fear for his life if he returned to Ethiopia, he said in a press conference following the race that he would, \"try and move to another country.\" One of the countries he mentioned was the U.S. and the State Department was asked about this possibility.After the resignation of Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn in March 2018, his successor Abiy Ahmed encouraged him to return home to his country in October 2018, ending his two year exile.\n",
